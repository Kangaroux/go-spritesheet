This example reads a sprite sheet YAML config, prints the config info, and lists each sprite and its location.

## Output:

```
       image: sheet.png
 sprite size: 32px
# of sprites: 5
        rows: 1
        cols: 5

sprites:
         top: (32,0) to (64,32)
       right: (64,0) to (96,32)
      bottom: (96,0) to (128,32)
        left: (128,0) to (160,32)
        fill: (0,0) to (32,32)
```
